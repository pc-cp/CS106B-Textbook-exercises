For keeping track of exercises done while self-studying [Programming Abstractions in C++](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1136/materials/CS106BX-Reader.pdf), repositories that may be helpful are: [programming-abstractions](https://github.com/heavy3/programming-abstractions)

The exercises that were not completed due to personal reasons are recorded as follows:
The format is (Exercise-Chapter Number-Question Number)
1. E-8-3 (No idea)
2. E-8-11 (I think it repeats E-8-5)
3. E-8-13 (Stanford's graphics library is somewhat troublesome)
4. E-8-15
5. E-8-16
6. E-8-17
