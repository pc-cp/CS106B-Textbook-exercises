For keeping track of exercises done while self-studying [Programming Abstractions in C++](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1136/materials/CS106BX-Reader.pdf), repositories that may be helpful are: [programming-abstractions](https://github.com/heavy3/programming-abstractions)

The exercises that were not completed due to personal reasons are recorded as follows:
The format is (Exercise-Chapter Number-Question Number)
1. E-8-3 (No idea)
2. E-8-11 (I think it repeats E-8-5)
3. E-8-13 (Stanford's graphics library is somewhat troublesome)
4. E-8-15
5. E-8-16
6. E-8-17
7. E-13-11 (The linked list contains no dummy cell is not elegant.)
8. E-14-4 (boring and repeatable problem)
9. E-14-5 (boring and repeatable problem)
10. E-14-6 (unnecessary)
11. E-14-12 (Using linked lists to achieve string drives me crazy.)
12. E-15-8/9/10 (I've actually benefited from toString in E-15-7, and I think it's time for the next chapter in the limited time available.)
13. E-16-9 (The rotation of AVL makes me dazzling.)
14. E-16-12 (red-black trees ...)
15. E-17-3 prime number
16. E-17-4 Repeat with 17-1
17. E-17-7/8/9 (I think it's time for the next chapter in the limited time available.)
18. E-18-1/2/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13 (Graph theory is vast, but some of these topics are filling up the questions?)
